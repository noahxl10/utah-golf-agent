# IN DEVELOPMENT
FYI - I'm in a "deliver  first, fix bugs second" mindset with this until it gains user traction.

# Utah Tee Time
## A project aimed at simplifiying golf tee time bookings across the state of Utah.
 Right now, if I want to find my preferrable tee time at a course, I have to manually search every single course's tee time booking system (typically Chronogolf for the muni courses)

This app solves that - every available tee time is listed and can be filtered by desired specs.

## TLDR;
I like to golf.

Golf has a few issues.

9 holes takes a lot of time. 18 holes takes a lot of time - unfortunately, I can't fix this.

However, the second issue, the lack of unified booking searching - that, I can fix.
